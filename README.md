# Hello 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻 📱

Hi, I'm Andrew. I am an iOS developer who writes code carefully, deliberately, and with humility. If you're based in the UK you have probably heard of a few of the apps that I have worked on.

- I am interested in Swift, SwiftUI and Vapor. 

- I can be found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5508175/andrew) where I try to answer people's questions to the best of my ability. 

- I am **passionate** about accessibility, and I feel that making inclusive apps is what we all should be doing. 

- I used to be pretty good at Numberwang.
